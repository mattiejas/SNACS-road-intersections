I've attached a copy of my anf code.  It's actually just a single .c
file which has instructions on building at the head of the file.
It computes either:

N(h) : number of pairs of nodes within distance h for h = 0 to the
       estimated diameter, or
N(x,h) : number of nodes within distance h of node x for each node, x,
       and each distance, h.

There are two warnings that I should give you.  First, you can't reliably
compute the diameter of the grain with this code.  It is an approximation
and will be fooled by, for example, a giant clique which has a single
path that wanders off (it will lead you to believe that the diameter is 1,
not the length of this single path).  I got lazy with the N(x,h) computation
and you cannot use it for very large graphs (bigger than what you can
process in memory).  This is likely not a restriction if you're trying
to do it with dykstra's algorithm.

Let me know if you need more help with the software.

Cheers,
Chris.
